SOIS 490 - Capstone

I. Business Case

This project aims to develop a comprehensive physical to digital library conversion
system to address the inefficiencies in managing physical records within libraries. The
system will provide a user-friendly interface for both library customers and
administrators/librarians, assisting in the transition from traditional, paper-based record
keeping, to a more streamlined and accessible digital format.

XYZ is a public library that has been serving the community since 2023. The library’s
main activities and services include book lending from an extensive collection of books,
digital resources catering to its tech savvy patrons, community engagement through
children's programs, book clubs, reading workshops and community spaces that provide
educational support. Revenues primarily come from sources of funding, membership
fees, and grants. Despite its rich collection of physical resources, the library currently
faces challenges in terms of organizing and accessing information efficiently.


Team Project Overview, Deliverables, and Submission Checklist

Project Overview

•	You will work in teams to produce an interactive information system. There are two main parts to the project:
1.	Build an actual system from scratch. This is the “capstone” for your degree because it gives you a chance to pull together all the skills in web design, user interface creation, database querying, systems analysis, and PHP you have developed in the other BSIST courses and actually apply them. It also gives you something tangible to talk to prospective employers about.
2.	Demonstrate your project management skills. So you have to use Microsoft Project to manage the project and produce a selection of documents (see below).
•	Real systems take a long time to develop and require extensive testing, training, data conversion, etc.  In this class, you will not have the opportunity to complete all these tasks. The system you produce will be called a prototype. However, make no mistake: a prototype is a working, functional, stable system – just at a smaller level than the production system. In your project management plan, include the whole system development effort, running through initiation, planning, execution of the prototype, execution of the main system, testing, training, evaluation, etc. You will only be required to execute those plans as far as the end of the prototype stage. The package submitted to at the end of the course would be the results of the prototype stage.
•	Please be sure that your system works fully with no errors.
•	If it is discovered that a team claims credit for work they did not produce themselves then this will be dealt with as academic dishonesty and punished according to the class policy. People have failed the course as a result of this in the past.
•	Your team is free to select whatever technology you wish to use but not coding frameworks. I recommend you use the system you developed in SOIS 440 and bring it up to the level required (if it isn’t already) for this class.


Project Deliverables

This is the list of what your team must create and turn in at the end of the term. You are required to use MS Project for the course. You can access MS Project on the Virtual Desktop via Citrix.  There are 2 examples of what a team’s final deliverable should look like posted on Canvas.

1.	Business Case and Scope Statement
•	When writing the Business Case, make sure that it explains basic things such as what the organization is, what its main activities are, where its revenues come from, and so on. This gives the context to understand how and why the system you are building is an appropriate way of addressing its needs. In a real project, top management or outside stakeholders such as investors might be unfamiliar with the context.
•	In the Scope Statement, make sure that your list of “Project Management-Related Deliverables” is complete and shows only those items that you will actually produce. Have a scope exclusions section as well.
•	It is important to keep straight the difference between deliverables and activities. Deliverables are things that you produce and deliver to the client. These may be the final products (such as a completed system) or intermediate items used to guide work in future project stages (such as a work breakdown schedule or prototype). Activities are things that you do. Some of these will directly produce deliverables, others will not. Make sure that your deliverables for things like the list of “Product-Related Deliverables” in the Scope Statement are all deliverables and not activities. Likewise, make sure that the things listed in the Work Breakdown Schedule really are all activities.
•	You should have an "Assumptions and Constraints" section to document anything that is essential for the success of the project but outside the direct control of the team members responsible.

2.	WBS, Gantt Chart, and Milestones
•	Once you have all the appropriate information in MS Project these deliverables will be very easy to generate. This is why part of the course requirement is that you learn MS Project up front.
•	Deliverables all have to be created somewhere. Before submitting the report make sure that each deliverable is being created by one or more specific activities in the WBS. For example, every team has to produce a prototype, documentation for it, etc. So there had better be some activities in the WBS that would produce a prototype.
•	Keep the planning and schedule data real since you are actually running a project that starts and ends in this term.
•	The milestone report is one of the easiest ones. Just list all the milestones and due dates. Project has a report that will show this for you

3.	Financial and Resource Aspects - Cost Estimates, ROI, etc.
•	Cost estimates must be included in your Project plan. Enter in and calculate your initial costs, activities, duration, and resource information. Add fixed costs for all the tasks that have them into MS Project.
•	Per the MS Project tutorial, the breakdown of categories for the costs are taken directly from the WBS for the project. Yours should be too. This will happen automatically as long as you use Project to produce them.
•	Calculate NPV, ROI and Payback and remember that you have to include detail on your assumptions about benefits.

4.	Risks – list both business and technical risks.

5.	System Prototype
•	It is important to come up with a system of suitable scope right away. Sometimes teams attempt too much and finish up with an ambitious plan but deliver only various pieces of unfinished code and broken screens. Other times teams produce systems that work as planned but are too trivial in scope to earn full credit.  This is why using your SOIS 440 system works well.
•	Your system should include Input, Output, Processing, and Data Storage (database or table.) At a minimum, you need screens related to three different kinds of data each held in its own table. For example: customers, products, and orders. Or users, equipment types, and equipment items. You should be able to add, edit and delete records of each kind. (Note: this does not mean that you need separate screens for each operation -- better to integrate buttons for these operations onto the same screen). Your system should include at least one report.
•	You should include error-checking and messages i.e. required input.
•	You will have different kinds of users for the system, so there will usually be front and back end aspects to the interface. Administrative users will generally have to log in and will receive additional options. Depending on the system this may involve different screens, or just additional buttons appearing on the same screens.
•	Make the prototype as polished as possible and be sure that the navigation is very easy and intuitive.
•	Your system must work without any errors or your team will not receive a passing grade and hence, fail the class.
•	Note: creating a read-only web site or a minimalistic system without all 4 components (Input, Output, Processing, Data Storage) will cause you to fail the class.

6.	System Documentation: User
•	The user documentation should describe everything possible users of the system would need to know. You should base the documentation around actual tasks the users would need to perform, rather than just going through one screen and button at a time. Cross reference this with your analysis of users to make sure it covers all the different kinds of users (for example customers and managers). Make sure that your documentation accurately reflects the prototype. If you change the system, change the documentation.

7.	System Documentation: Technical
•	The technical documentation is also very important; both as a deliverable in its own right and as a way of making sure the instructor understands the amount of work that went into your system.
•	It is important that the technical documentation gives a good sense of what you produced for the project and how much work was involved. So be sure to include any code you wrote for the project. Include a detailed statement explaining the main configuration work and what =was involved in this work. For example, maybe you installed some extensions, integrated two systems, customized a theme. The more detail you give, the more points you will receive.
•	Include the Entity Relationship Diagram and associated table schemas. Every system involves a database, and hence these are appropriate and important.
•	The technical documentation should include a system architecture diagram. You can use Visio or PowerPoint to complete that. The diagram should show all major hardware and software components of your systems, and the connections and relationships between them. Make sure it is clear which software processes (for example a web server or DBMS system) are running on which computers. Show communications as arrows between software processes (for example from web server to middleware software) rather than between computers.
